# Political Analytics: Predicting Voter Behavior and Decoding Presidential Rhetoric
Project Based on Machine Learning 
## Overview
	This document outlines the analysis performed on two datasets: voter preferences based on demographic and socio-economic factors, and speeches from 	U.S. Presidents. The goal is to build a predictive model for voter support and analyze the linguistic patterns in presidential speeches.
## Contents
	Problem 1: Voter Preference Prediction
	Objective: 
		Predict which political party a voter is likely to support using machine learning techniques.
	Key Variables:
		Vote choice (Conservative or Labour)
		Age, economic condition assessments, leader assessments, attitudes toward European integration, political knowledge, and gender.
	Key Steps:
		Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
			Analyzed data shape, types, and performed univariate and multivariate analyses.
			Visualized patterns and insights using appropriate plots.
		Data Preprocessing:
			Treated missing values and outliers.
			Encoded categorical variables for modeling.
			Split data into training and test sets.
		Model Building:
			Built various models including KNN, Naive Bayes, Bagging, and Boosting.
			Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC scores.
	Problem 2: Presidential Speech Analysis
	Objective: 
		Analyze speeches from U.S. Presidents to extract meaningful insights about language usage over time.
	Key Steps:
		Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
			Analyzed the number of characters, words, and sentences in the speeches.
		Text Cleaning:
			Removed stop words and performed stemming to prepare text data for analysis.
			Identified the three most common words used in all speeches.
		Word Cloud Visualization:
			Created word clouds to visually represent the most frequently used words in each speech.
## Conclusion
	The analyses conducted provide valuable insights into voter behavior and linguistic trends in political speeches. These insights can guide strategic 	decisions aimed at optimizing election campaigns and understanding historical political communication. This README file summarizes the objectives, 	methodologies, findings, and conclusions drawn from the analyses performed on the datasets provided. Adjustments can be made based on specific details 	or additional insights derived from your analysis.
